## What I Built

Every developer knows this moment: it's standup time, someone asks "what did you do yesterday?" and your mind goes completely blank. You stare at your terminal, maybe run `git log`, and try to reconstruct your day from cryptic commit messages like `fix: resolve edge case` and `wip: stuff`.

I run bootstrapped startups from Addis Ababa. No team lead reviewing my PRs, no standup bot. Just me and my git history. I needed a way to look back at a day, a week, a release — and actually understand what happened. Not commit hashes. Stories.

**devlog** is a CLI tool that reads your git history and uses GitHub Copilot CLI to transform raw commits into human-readable narratives — daily journals, standup reports, weekly recaps, and release notes.

But here's the part that genuinely surprised me: **Copilot CLI doesn't just summarize commit messages. It reads your actual source code.** When I ran `devlog standup` on a test project, it opened my `auth.ts` file, saw that the function returned hardcoded `true`, and flagged it as a blocker. I asked it for a standup and it gave me a code review. I didn't expect that.

### Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `devlog today` | AI-generated journal of today's work |
| `devlog standup` | Yesterday / Today / Blockers format |
| `devlog week` | Weekly recap grouped by day |
| `devlog release` | Categorized release notes since last tag |
| `devlog recap a1b2..c3d4` | Summarize any custom commit range |

Every command exports to Markdown (`-o file.md`) or JSON (`--json`) for automation.

**The meta moment:** I used devlog to generate its own development journal. It works.

### `devlog today` — What did I actually do?

Running `devlog today` in any git repo gives you this:

### `devlog standup` — The one that blew my mind

This is where Copilot CLI went beyond what I thought it could do. I ran `devlog standup` and it didn't just list my commits — **it opened my source files and identified real issues:**

```

Those blockers are **real**. Copilot CLI actually read `src/auth.ts`, saw the stub `return true`, noticed there are no tests, and flagged that validation is too minimal for production. I asked for a standup report and got a code review. This isn't summarization — it's Copilot CLI's agentic capabilities turning commit metadata into actionable insight.

### Export to Markdown & JSON

```bash
# Save today's journal for your team wiki
devlog today -o journal.md

# Pipe JSON into other tools or Slack bots
devlog today --json | jq '.summary'

# Weekly recap as a markdown file
devlog week -o weekly-recap.md
```

### Try it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Garinmckayl/devlog-cli.git
cd devlog-cli
npm install && npm run build
cd /any/git/repo
node /path/to/devlog-cli/dist/index.js today
```

## My Experience with GitHub Copilot CLI

### Copilot CLI as the Product's Brain

devlog uses `gh copilot -- -p` (the prompt interface) as its AI backend. Here's what it does under the hood:

**Input:** Raw commit data formatted as a prompt:
```
Summarize these git commits from today in "my-project" by Natnael 
as a short developer journal entry:

- [a3f21bc] feat: add user authentication flow (files: src/auth.ts, src/middleware.ts)
- [9c0e412] fix: resolve token expiration edge case (files: src/auth.ts)
- [7fd7744] refactor: clean up error handling (files: src/utils/errors.ts)
```

**Output from Copilot CLI:** A structured, narrative summary that groups related work, identifies patterns, and even reads source files when available.

The standup command is where it gets wild. I pass yesterday's and today's commits, and Copilot CLI:
1. Summarizes what was done
2. Infers what's planned based on the direction of work
3. **Identifies potential blockers by actually reading the code** — it caught stubbed functions, missing tests, and oversimplified validation

### The Agentic Surprise

I built devlog expecting Copilot CLI to be a text summarizer. Feed it commit messages, get a paragraph back. What I didn't anticipate was the agentic behavior — Copilot CLI actually inspects your working directory. In the standup output above, you can see it ran `ls`, read `src/auth.ts`, read `package.json`, and used that context to generate blockers I hadn't even thought of.

This changes what a "commit summarizer" can be. It's not reformatting `git log`. It's understanding your project.

### Copilot CLI as My Dev Companion

I also used Copilot CLI throughout the build process:

- **`gh copilot -- -p "What's the best way to parse git log dates in ISO 8601 format with simple-git?"`** — Saved me from a timezone bug. Copilot CLI explained that `simple-git` returns dates in ISO format but the `--after` flag needs a specific format string.

- **`gh copilot -- -p "How do I detect the latest git tag and get commits since that tag?"`** — Led me to `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` which I wouldn't have found easily in docs.

- **Architecture discussions** — I described what I wanted to build and Copilot CLI helped me structure the modules: separating git parsing, AI integration, UI rendering, and export into clean boundaries.

### The Fallback Design

Without Copilot CLI, devlog still works — it falls back to keyword-based categorization (feat/fix/refactor). But with Copilot CLI, it becomes genuinely intelligent. The standup blockers, the code-aware summaries, the narrative structure — all of that requires Copilot CLI.

### Tech Stack

- TypeScript + Node.js
- `simple-git` — git log parsing
- `commander` — CLI interface
- `chalk` + `boxen` + `ora` — terminal UI
- `date-fns` — date manipulation
- GitHub Copilot CLI (`gh copilot -- -p`) — AI-powered summarization, categorization, and code-aware standup generation
